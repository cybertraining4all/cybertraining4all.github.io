# Homelab Resources

<h2> Getting Started </h2>

To get started on building a home lab you first have to decide how you want to host the home lab. Do you want to use your primary PC (not recommended) or do you want to use dedicated hardware. Both options have their benefits, however, using dedicated hardware will allow you to learn industry-leading hypervisors which are used in corporate environments.
