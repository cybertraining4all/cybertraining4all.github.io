As a working cyber security professional, a cyber security instructor, and a speaker, Scott is sharing his knowledge and experience with the world around cyber security. Currently Cybercrime is the third largest economy behind the United States and China and it is likly to only get worse. There is a significant gap in the skills required to hire the next level of cyber professionals and there is a gap of understanding and training for employees in general to protect organizaitons against cyber crime. The tools and presentations shown here are to help bridge that gap regardless of the technical level of the audience.
